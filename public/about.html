<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am from a small town in Indiana and live with my wife and two kids. I have been in a variety of roles and industries.
  It took a long time for me to figure out what I want for a career. I tried various roles, did well in most, but none seemed right for me.
  I got into coding, and discovered web development. I enjoy using HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create websites. There is nothing quite like being able to create something, 
  and seeing my hard work produce a website gives me much fullfillment. 

</p>

<p>I have always been complemented on my work ethic. I was raised on a farm and got used to working hard and not stopping until the job was finished.
  This was hammered into me even further when I joined the United States Navy Reserve. I carried that work ethic into the working world and always look for ways to improve myself.
